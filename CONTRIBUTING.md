It is indeed great to recommend a book! In a way, it can be construed that you are helping people around you to read something which is 
worth their time. However, a set of guidlines must be followed to ensure the quality of Minerva's recommendations remain great.

- Please fill in your book according to the **Pull Request Template**.
- Ping the maintainer of the repository after no decision has been taken about your book since the last **6** days.
- To include a book, you have to write the book title, the name of the author, the GoodReads recommendation and a brief description about why **you** would recommend it to read; not the GoodReads bio!
- All these details have to be written in the `readme.md` itself.
