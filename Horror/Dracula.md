### Why do you think the book is a must-read?

> It's the most well-known vampire novel.
> It's classic.
> The story itself is heartbreaking, full of the emotion of the characters as they deal with life, death and love, this is beautifully realised. 
> The main characters are all very well portrayed, each with a separate personality, quirks and role to play in the story. 
> The plot is too complicated for reproduction, but it says no little  for the authors powers that in spite of its absurdities the reader can follow the story with interest to the end. It is, however, an artistic mistake to fill the whole volume with horrors. A touch of the mysterious, the terrible, or the supernatural is infinitely more effective and credible. (The Manchester Guardian, June 15, 1897)
