# Minerva


## Motivation

The Roman goddess of wisdom and literature strongly recommends you to read these books to make you an 'enlightened' person and 
give you her blessing.
But since she herself cannot descend upon the Earth, she has instructed a group of readers to make this list and thus enlighten people.

## Submitting a new book

To include your suggested book, please pull a request and fill out the template. Your PR will then be discussed among and then included in 
the list.
