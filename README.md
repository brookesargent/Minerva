## Motivation

The Roman goddess of wisdom and literature strongly recommends you to read these books to make you an 'enlightened' person and 
give you her blessing.
But since she herself cannot descend upon the Earth, she has instructed a group of readers to make this list and thus enlighten people.

## Submitting a new book

## IT

### General details

> **Title:** It

> **Author:** Stephen King

> **Genre:** Horror, Fiction, Fantasy, Thriller

> **Goodreads:**  4.22 Stars - 610,639 Ratings - 18,239 Reviews

### Why do you think the book is a must-read?

> It is one of those books that really doesn't take off until about page 500. What goes before is, depending on your point of view, either laying groundwork or spinning wheels. I like to think that King's hesitation to write the book, which he talks about a lot, meant that he really had to work up his nerve on the page before diving in.

> IT has a lot of characters, that's one of King's best features as a writer (his ability to write a lot of memorable characters) but only (only!) about 10 are important to the overall story, the rest are there to flush out the world and give heft to the situations of the important folks.

> It's about 7 children who live in Derry, Maine, which is the town under the spell of IT. And it started in the 1950s and there was a parallel story happening that took place in the 1980s, which was 27 years later. Every 27 years, bad things happen.

> It's not just child murders, it's disasters and actually nobody notices them which makes it very strange.

> That's enough for spoilers xD.

### Does this book contain any profane, violent or vulgar content?

> Yes
