## Motivation

The Roman goddess of wisdom and literature strongly recommends you to read these books to make you an 'enlightened' person and 
give you her blessing.
But since she herself cannot descend upon the Earth, she has instructed a group of readers to make this list and thus enlighten people.

## Submitting a new book

## IT

### General details

> **Goodreads:** https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/830502.It

### Why do you think the book is a must-read?

> Well, I've read this book many times and I really want to share it with you guys.

> This book is not just horror, it's funny, it's endearing and I fell in love the characters.

> I think the main thing about this book is the friendship between the characters in the story, with friendship they can get over their fears.

> It's about 7 children who live in Derry, Maine, which is the town under the spell of IT. And it started in the 1950s and there was a parallel story happening that took place in the 1980s, which was 27 years later. Every 27 years, bad things happen.

> It's not just child murders, it's disasters and actually nobody notices them which makes it very strange.

> That's enough for spoilers xD.

### Does this book contain any profane, violent or vulgar content?

> Yes
